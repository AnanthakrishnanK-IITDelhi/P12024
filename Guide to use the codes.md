The codes need to be run in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software 64-bit professional version V11.683.

Code 1: Design UA for VCS
This code gives the UA for the evaporator and condeser for the design ambient conditions and zone conditons based on AHRI 210/240.

Code 2: Master code for system simulation
This code  includes the parametric optimization for air channel number in the dehumidifier, cooling water temperature and liquid desiccant flow rates.
Using the optimized geometry, the performance of the hybrid system is compared with the conventional vapor compression system and minimum thermodynamic work for different climatic conditions across India.
Also, the enhancement in Nusselt number requried for potential reduction in the sizes of the dehumidifier and regenerator modules upto 50% are included in the parametric table in code 2.
