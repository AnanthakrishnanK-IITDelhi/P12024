The codes need to be run in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software 64-bit professional version V11.683.

Code 1: Design UA for VCS

This code gives the UA for the evaporator and condeser for the design ambient conditions and zone conditons based on AHRI 210/240.

Code 2: Model Validation 

This code is about validating the adiabatic dehumidifier against the experimental data of Huang et al.(2012). Run the parametric table and uncertainty propogation to obtain the validation results.

Code 3: Master code for system simulation

This code  includes the parametric optimization for air channel number in the dehumidifier, cooling water temperature and liquid desiccant flow rates.
Using the optimized geometry, the performance of the hybrid system is compared with the conventional vapor compression system and minimum thermodynamic work for different climatic conditions across India.
Also, the enhancement in Nusselt number requried for potential reduction in the sizes of the dehumidifier and regenerator modules upto 50% are included in the parametric table in code 2.
